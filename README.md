## Bold

Use bold to highlight button names, fields names, menus, radio buttons, or checkboxes. For example:

- Click the **Create** button to start the process.
- Enter your IP address in the **IP Address** field.

## Italics

Use italics to emphasize a word or group of words. For example:

- *At least* two reviews are required before you check in your code.
- You must *not* enter without your ID card.

> **IMPORTANT**: Use this style sparingly to avoid diluting its strength.

## Fixed Font

Use a fixed font to highlight:

- **Commands or pieces of code**. For example:
Run the `npm install text-cli` command to install the utility.

- **File or folder names**. For example:
Read the README.md file before you proceed.

## Abbreviations

Never use the following abbreviations in a formal document:

| Abbreviation  | Elaboration |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| e.g. | Instead use "for example". |
| i.e. | Instead use "in other words". |
| etc. | Instead give the full list of options. |
| fig. | Instead spell it out as "figure". |
| pg. | Instead spell it ous as "page". |

## Capitalization

Use standard capitalization rules. Also, keep in mind the following:

- The first word after a colon  (\( :\)) is always capitalized.
- Every heading, table caption, figure caption, column name, or a callout in a figure or table mus be in the title case.

## Acronyms

Always define an acronym when you are using for the first time.
For example: This section specifies the term used in a Product Requirement Document (PRD).
The most often used terms in a PRD include...

## Commas in Lists

The rules regarding commas for in-sentence lists are as follow:

- Do not use a comma before "and" and "or" if your list contains *only two items*. For example:
Any new organization needs to invest in good infrastructure and hiring great talent.
- Use a commma before "nad" and "or" when your list comprises *three or more items*. For example. A "Pod" comprises a Project Manager, a Technical Writer, Engineers, and UX designers.

## Numbers

Remember these rules about numbers:

- Spell out numbers that are less than 10 (0 - 9). For example: I have seven aunts.
- Use numerals for 10 and higher.
For example: This hub has 32 ports.
- Use a comma to make it easier to read numbers higher than 999.
For example: The network supports up to 10,000 connections.

## Contractions

Contractions are considered informal writing. To prevent "stuffiness" use the contraction "don't". Avoid other contractions suh as "it's" or "doesn't".

## Apostrophes

Do not use an apostrophe for the plural of acronyms. For example:

| Don'ts | Dos |
| ------ | --- |
| API's | Instead use APIs |
| LAN's | Insted use LANs |
